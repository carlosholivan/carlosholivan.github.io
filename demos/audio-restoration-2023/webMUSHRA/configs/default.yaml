      content: Welcome to this MUSHRA test. In this test you will be asked to listen to audio examples and rate the quality of the audio. This test contains 3 subtests for declipping, bandwidth extension and deplipping tasks. Each test contains 5 pages. The approximate duration of the test is 15 minutes. Please use headphones for this test.

      content: This is practicing part for listening test. <br> Before starting, please make sure to use headphones suitable for listening to music and adjust volume (Once you decide volume, please do not change it until end). <br> <br> Please read following description and try to evaluate each sample. <br> Please listen to each sample and Reference (original vocal) and <b> Please, <b> evaluate how well each sample matches the reference.</b> <br> Please rate with this way (Excellent: Well restored, Good: restored, Fair: Somehow restored, Poor: Not removed, Bad: Not restored at all).</b> <b> Please ignore noise and auditory quality and try to evaluate each sample only on extent of the audio restoration task addressed in each subtest</b>. <br> You can listen to samples many times. <br> We ask you to evaluate 3 tasks including declipping, band extension and inpainting. The first test begins from next page. Current page is demo page.
